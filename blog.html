        <h2>Inside Out and Back Again</h2>
        <p>
          "We have to leave," I tell my children one night.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >I am a refugee. <br />
            I am an outsider. <br />
          </em>
          This is what I am thinking as I huddle with children under the deck
          of a ship, as the waves continue to pound and crash around me. <br />
          My daughter is now scribbling on the writing pad I gave her next to me. 
          Over the words she's written there are drawings of food. 
          I look down at small portion of food they have given us. <br>
          Only yesterday it was ____
          I think of home. Of life when <br>
          Of 
          A black sesame sweet and banana tapioca was the only treat I managed to scrape together for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's time to go!" I remember hearing.<p>

          My daughter desperately wanted to have a say in this blog, so here.

        <p>I still miss:</p>
